Observer Design Pattern:




The observer design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object (known as the subject) to notify a set of objects (known as observers) when its state changes. This allows the observers to be kept in sync with the subject and receive updates about its state.



Implementation:




To implement the observer design pattern, you will need to define a subject interface with methods for adding and removing observers, as well as for notifying them of state changes. You will also need to define an observer interface with a method for receiving updates from the subject.

Next, you will need to create a concrete subject class that implements the subject interface. This class should maintain a list of observers and provide methods for adding and removing them, as well as for notifying them of state changes.

Finally, you will need to create concrete observer classes that implement the observer interface and register themselves with the subject to receive updates.
